#CSS TO THE RES-Q

## ASSIGNMENT
I've chosen to create a magazine that supports day and night mode

### Restrictions
		-  2 colors
		-  Responsive without mediaqueries

## Extra Restriction
		- I've been assigned to do stuff with BEM

## What have I already done

I have been researching how to get into the crazy world of responsiveness without media queries. I came up with a doodle made with the help of flexbox. Which works fine but introduces some problems.
I've also been experimenting with some css in javascript, wich != part of the assignment. But c'mon, It's fun.. 

## Bem

Honestly, I haven't looked into bem yet. Wich I should ASAP
